CONSULTATION Consultation services are available to the entire UCI community. No identifying information about a student is needed for a consultation. The CSW helps determine the scope and level of services needed, which can include emergency housing, transportation information, community medical clinics, mental health services, or general information about a community or campus service. Examples include help for a student who: •is in need of food or shelter •is in need of transportation resources •needs referrals to counseling services outside of UCI •needs general information on alternative options for medical insurance •has had a death in family and needs assistance with funeral costs CASE MANAGEMENT The CSW manages cases for high-risk students who have several psychosocial stressors, which are impacting their performance or experience at UCI. Faculty or staff who believe a student would benefit from case management services, should obtain consent from the student prior to requesting the CSW's assistance. We provide ongoing support and follow-up for a student who: •has been diagnosed with psychiatric disorder and needed hospitalization •has recently been discharged from a health facility and is re-entering university life •is affected by a medical condition and needs coordination or multiple services and resources •is impacted by various psychosocial stressors and is in academic jeopardy STUDENT DEATH COORDINATION  When the death of a UCI student occurs, it is incumbent upon the University to act quickly in a caring, professional manner to assist the family and survivors in brokering any supportive services. The Campus Social Worker is the designated person responsible for ensuring coordination, communication and management of notifications that may be necessary in response to a student death. The CSW will work with the deceased student's family/next of kin and the campus community in order to expedite all administrative affairs. PRIVACY The CSW cannot discuss the details of a student's situation with others, including the referring party, without the consent of the student. In an event there is an urgent health or safety concern, (such as if an individual expresses being a danger to self or others, is gravely disabled, or if there is suspected child or elder abuse), the Campus Social Worker is mandated by the law and professional ethics to disclose the information to appropriate professional entities, in order to support the individual. When it is in the best interest of the individual and with the person's consent, the Campus Social Worker shall promote collaboration among academic and administrative departments, the Campus Consultation Team, outside organizations and service delivery systems, to facilitate goal attainment. Such collaboration enhances organizational and systemic capacity to support students, staff and faculty and reduces inappropriateness, duplication, or fragmentation of services.",

An Officer having probable cause may take a person into custody and place the person in an approved mental health facility for 72 hour treatment and evaluation when the officer believes that, as a result of a mental disorder, the person is a danger to him/herself or others or the person is gravely disabled (Welfare and Institutions Code, 5150; Welfare and Institutions Code, 5585.50).  Designated Psychiatric Facility: - UCIPD transports UCI affiliates who are placed on a 5150 to the UC Irvine Health Medical Center emergency department, a designated psychiatric facility, for further psychiatric evaluation. All non-affiliates are transported to the nearest designated psychiatric facility pursuant to the Orange County Chiefs’ of Police and Sheriff’s Association Operational & Procedural Protocol (number 127, revised July 31, 2012).  UCI Counseling Center: - When a subject does not meet the criteria for a 5150 or it is unclear if the subject meets the criteria, UCIPD may bring the subject voluntarily, if a student, to the UCI Counseling Center to receive counseling services.  Orange County Centralized Assessment Team (CAT): - When a subject, other than a UCI student, does not meet the criteria for a 5150 or it is unclear if the subject meets the criteria, UCIPD may request the Orange County CAT to respond to further assess the subject. This includes calling the Orange County CAT to evaluate UCI students after operating hours of the UCI Counseling Center.  Medical Attention Required: - If a subject requires medical attention, UCIPD requests the Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA) to respond. OCFA determines if the subject needs additional medical treatment and transports to the nearest available medical facility. UCIPD follows OCFA to the hospital and ensures a safe transfer of the patient to the medical personnel at the hospital. Once medically cleared, the Orange County CAT responds to complete the psychiatric evaluation of the subject for 5150 WIC.  UCI Consultation Team: - The purpose of the UCI Consultation Team is to bring the collective wisdom, professional perspectives, campus management and agency responsibility to bear on a crisis that, because of its reach, complexity, or potential for risk, demands the involvement of multiple campus departments. (UCI Wellness, Health & Counseling Services) UCIPD provides a summary of all mental health related police reports to the UC Irvine Consultation team to enable the UCI Social Worker to follow-up and provide available resources and support to the subject.",

Thought leaders who have previously delivered this annual lecture include Harry Belafonte, Yolanda King, Cornel West, and Lani Guinier.\r\n- IDX: Identity Exploration Series (formerly known as Winter Leadership Seminars) is for students who are looking to continue their leadership growth. Seminars are created for students to: critically engage in conversations about how their identity affects and shapes their leadership qualities; acquire new skill sets; and, to prepare students to take action against social injustices. IDX includes: African American Leadership Seminar, Asian American Pacific Islander Leadership Seminar, Chicanx/Latinx Leadership Seminar, Diversity and Social Justice in the U.S. Seminar, and Racial Justice Ally Leadership Seminar.\r\n- Professional Development for Student Leaders Series is designed specifically for those aspiring to gain social and navigational capital to be successful at the institution, in the world of work, and society at large. Programs are culturally relevant to our diverse students and participants will engage in workshops and candid discussions on professional etiquette and communication, code-switching, networking, representation in social media, financial wellness, agency building, and how these topics relate to one’s cultural identity, societal norms, and stereotypes.\r\n- Reaffirming Ethnic Awareness and Community Harmony (REACH) is a multifaceted, educational outreach program that aims to educate and train student facilitators for peer intergroup dialogue. Approximately 25 students attend a yearlong for-credit class to learn about various diversity and social justice related topics, as well as how to facilitate difficult dialogues effectively. These students facilitate workshops for peers interested in conversing about these topics by request. \r\n- REAL Talk involves a team of students, staff, and faculty who are storytellers with a message. They challenge and change the various ideas and worldviews that may hinder a positive campus climate and socially just society. REAL Talk utilizes transformative storytelling by sharing their personal story of how they overcame a societal barrier or particular incident related to their intersecting identities – whether it be their race, ethnicity, religion, ability status, gender, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, citizenship. REAL Talk also provides a supportive space for those who want to tell their story, be validated, and empowered. Individuals interested in joining the team can attend weekly meetings which take place throughout the academic year.",
