An Officer having probable cause may take a person into custody and place the person in an approved mental health facility for 72 hour treatment and evaluation when the officer believes that, as a result of a mental disorder, the person is a danger to him/herself or others or the person is gravely disabled (Welfare and Institutions Code, 5150; Welfare and Institutions Code, 5585.50).  Designated Psychiatric Facility: - UCIPD transports UCI affiliates who are placed on a 5150 to the UC Irvine Health Medical Center emergency department, a designated psychiatric facility, for further psychiatric evaluation. All non-affiliates are transported to the nearest designated psychiatric facility pursuant to the Orange County Chiefs’ of Police and Sheriff’s Association Operational & Procedural Protocol (number 127, revised July 31, 2012).  UCI Counseling Center: - When a subject does not meet the criteria for a 5150 or it is unclear if the subject meets the criteria, UCIPD may bring the subject voluntarily, if a student, to the UCI Counseling Center to receive counseling services.  Orange County Centralized Assessment Team (CAT): - When a subject, other than a UCI student, does not meet the criteria for a 5150 or it is unclear if the subject meets the criteria, UCIPD may request the Orange County CAT to respond to further assess the subject. This includes calling the Orange County CAT to evaluate UCI students after operating hours of the UCI Counseling Center.  Medical Attention Required: - If a subject requires medical attention, UCIPD requests the Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA) to respond. OCFA determines if the subject needs additional medical treatment and transports to the nearest available medical facility. UCIPD follows OCFA to the hospital and ensures a safe transfer of the patient to the medical personnel at the hospital. Once medically cleared, the Orange County CAT responds to complete the psychiatric evaluation of the subject for 5150 WIC.  UCI Consultation Team: - The purpose of the UCI Consultation Team is to bring the collective wisdom, professional perspectives, campus management and agency responsibility to bear on a crisis that, because of its reach, complexity, or potential for risk, demands the involvement of multiple campus departments. (UCI Wellness, Health & Counseling Services) UCIPD provides a summary of all mental health related police reports to the UC Irvine Consultation team to enable the UCI Social Worker to follow-up and provide available resources and support to the subject.",

These students facilitate workshops for peers interested in conversing about these topics by request. \r\n- REAL Talk involves a team of students, staff, and faculty who are storytellers with a message. They challenge and change the various ideas and worldviews that may hinder a positive campus climate and socially just society. REAL Talk utilizes transformative storytelling by sharing their personal story of how they overcame a societal barrier or particular incident related to their intersecting identities – whether it be their race, ethnicity, religion, ability status, gender, socio-economic status, sexual orientation, citizenship. REAL Talk also provides a supportive space for those who want to tell their story, be validated, and empowered.
